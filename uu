Good — that output tells us **exactly what’s happening** 👍

### What your `aplay -l` means

You currently have:

* ✅ **HDMI audio working** (both HDMI ports detected)
* ❌ **No headphone / 3.5mm audio device** (`rp1-audio` is missing)

So this is **not** a general audio failure — it’s specifically that the **Pi 5 analog audio driver is not enabled/loaded**.

---

## ✅ Fix: Enable Pi 5 headphone jack (rp1-audio)

### 1️⃣ Edit the correct config file (important on Pi 5)

```bash
sudo nano /boot/firmware/config.txt
```

### 2️⃣ Add (or ensure) these lines exist

```ini
dtparam=audio=on
dtoverlay=rp1-audio
```

⚠️ These are **mandatory on Raspberry Pi 5**
Older `bcm2835-audio` / PWM guides do NOT apply.

Save → Exit (`Ctrl+O`, Enter, `Ctrl+X`)

---

### 3️⃣ Reboot

```bash
sudo reboot
```

---

### 4️⃣ Verify

After reboot:

```bash
aplay -l
```

You should now see **something like**:

```
card 2: rp1audio [rp1-audio], device 0: rp1-audio
```

---

## 5️⃣ Select headphone output

### GUI

* Speaker icon → Audio Settings
* Output device → **Headphones (rp1-audio)**

### Terminal

```bash
raspi-config
```

→ System Options → Audio → Headphones

---

## If it STILL doesn’t appear

Run these and paste the output:

```bash
lsmod | grep rp1
dmesg | grep audio
```

---

## Summary

✔ HDMI audio = OK
❌ Headphone jack missing = `rp1-audio` overlay not enabled
🔧 Adding `dtoverlay=rp1-audio` fixes this on **almost every Pi 5**

Once you reboot, tell me:

* Does `rp1-audio` show up?
* Are you using the **3.5mm jack or HDMI** primarily?

We’re very close — this is a known Pi 5 gotcha.
